Community Supported

The software and templates in the repo are released under an as-is, best effort,
support policy. This software should be seen as community supported and SlashID 
will contribute our expertise as and when possible. We do not provide technical 
support or help in using or troubleshooting the components of
the project through our normal support options such as SlashID
support teams. Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our GitHub
repository (at https://github.com/SlashID) are provided
under the best effort policy.
